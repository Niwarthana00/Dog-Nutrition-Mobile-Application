        "content": "Beagles are similar in appearance to foxhounds. They’re smaller but with the same soft floppy ears, strong jaw, short hair, and (usually) tricolor coat.\n\nMost are tricolor, with white and black and light brown patches. However, some are two colors (like the lemon Beagle), with patches of tan, white, lemon, red, and more. Rarer colorings include ticking and mottling, such as with the blue tick Beagle, giving the dog a unique speckled look.\n\nAs far as grooming, most pet parents will find that this dog is easy to care for. Like other dogs with a double coat, Beagles shed their undercoat once or twice per year (or year-round in temperate climates), but for a short coat, weekly brushing as maintenance should be enough."

        "topic": "Beagle Personality: Gentle, Good-Tempered and Exciteable",
        "content": "  Beagle dogs are famously gentle and good-tempered, and while they can be cautious around strangers, they tend to warm up to them quickly (which makes for a poor guard dog). They are also excitable, which means that they’re prone to howling and barking when something seems amiss (which makes for a good watchdog).\n\nA defining feature of a hound-type dog is the impulse to follow one’s nose. When it comes to an interesting scent, a Beagle will be single-minded, and you’ll definitely need a leash, and a strong arm, to get them back.\n\nA note on scent hounds: Beagles, like other smell-obsessed dogs, will find and eat things you would rather them not eat. Areas you should consider dog-proofing include the pantry, the bathroom and kitchen trash cans, the diaper pail, the cat’s litter box, your dirty clothes basket…you get the idea."

        "topic": "Beagle Grooming",
        "content": "Beagles have medium-length coats, which don’t require as much grooming as dogs with longer hair. Because they are natural scent investigators, you may find that yours gets into smelly things more often. A bath with gentle shampoo will do the trick, but it’s important not to bathe your Beagle too often, as this could result in dry, itchy skin.\n\nEstablish a twice-weekly brushing routine. Using a natural-bristle brush, work along their coat in circular motions. This will loosen dead hair and encourage their skin to produce healthy natural oils. Like any breed, the benefits of hiring a professional groomer a few times per year are that they’ll trim nails, express their anal glands and clean ears."

        "content": "Although the Golden Retriever needs at least an hour of strenuous exercise daily, much of this can be met with games of fetch and other retrieving activities. It is a good companion for hiking and cool-weather jogging. Though generally not suited for marathons, Golden Retrievers can complete them with proper training and care that guards against overheating. Despite the dog’s obedience from a distance, off-leash exercise for the Golden Retriever should only be done in fenced areas or road-free areas; the Golden Retriever needs a fenced yard at home. It is a water-loving dog that enjoys swimming, but care must be taken not to let it swim to the point of exhaustion. The breed requires mental stimulation and challenges, which can be met by agility exercises, play, and field training that can include pointing, trailing, flushing out prey, and retrieving. The breed is one of the most versatile in competitive events, excelling at obedience, agility, tracking, retriever field trials, and dock diving (in which a dog leaps from a dock into the water to retrieve an item)."

        "content": "The Labrador retriever is a muscular breed of sporting dog known for its dependability as a guide dog for the blind and as a search-and-rescue dog. The coat is water-repellent, short, and dense and has a thick, hard undercoat. The breed colors may be solid black, dark brown, yellow, reddish, or cream. Ears are relatively small, are set far back on the head, and hang loosely almost to the side of the neck. The tail is short, thick, and rounded and is carried gaily. The retriever’s eyes express intelligence and are either brown, black, or yellow. The adult stands 21–25 in. (53–64 cm) tall at the shoulders and weighs 55–75 lbs (25–34 kg). Labrador retrievers are even-tempered and prefer a very active lifestyle. Despite its name, the breed originated in Newfoundland (not Labrador) as early as the 17th century and was used by hunters to retrieve waterfowl. The breed gradually died out in Newfoundland because of a heavy dog tax and strict quarantine laws. The breed was revived in England soon after. Labrador retrievers make an ideal pet for households with children."

Poodles require mental challenges as well as physical ones, so games and organized activities should be part of their routine. The breed is highly versatile.

No matter the variety, it is considered one of the most intelligent and easiest to train of all breeds. As befitting its water retriever heritage, it is adept at following signals from a distance. The dog’s ability to learn complex tasks earned it a place as a circus performer in earlier times, and it remains a top competitor in obedience and agility trials. Poodles are also used as service dogs.\n\nWhile all three varieties are energetic, toys and miniatures tend to be more active than standards. The breed is generally playful and fairly affectionate. It is friendly toward everyone and is not a fighter. Poodles make excellent watchdogs, though some can bark to excess. It should be noted that the claims above are traditional and widely accepted generalizations about the breed and that the behaviour of individual Poodles may differ."

And they’re most definitely shedders. These dogs typically shed once or twice per year, but they benefit from weekly grooming. (As well as daily brushing during shedding months.)\n\nAlthough most German Shepherds have either a medium or long coat, some German Shepherds have no undercoat, and therefore have different grooming needs. Make sure to learn how to care for your GSDs coat properly and maximize the natural benefits of their hair, while minimizing out-of-control shedding.

        "topic": "Temperament",
        "content": "Bulldogs require more care than most breeds. They are prone to more health problems than most breeds due to their short muzzle and flattened facial structure. Bulldogs are prone to overheating, especially in warm environments and under circumstances where they can overexert themselves. The Bulldog’s shortened muzzle makes the breed especially prone to brachycephalic syndrome—a condition in which the nostril openings (nares) are too small, the soft palate is elongated, and tissue in the airway may partially obstruct airflow. When the dog pants, these tissues can swell, further obstructing airflow and reducing the dog’s ability to cool itself. To prevent overheating, Bulldog owners should provide air conditioning in the home and car and travel with fans and ice packs in summer in case of a vehicle breakdown. The breed learns easily, and it can be taught to perform tricks, including skateboarding. It enjoys balls and other toys, but it is not much of a retriever. Despite spending much of its day lazing about, the Bulldog can enjoy brief, but not sustained, bursts of activity. It makes an unreliable guard dog or watchdog. It is not generally a barker, and, whereas its fierce expression may scare off intruders, it is likely to sleep through a break-in."

The ears are small and folded back, typically resembling a \"rose\" shape. The Bulldog's coat is short, smooth, and glossy, coming in a variety of colors including brindle, white, fawn, and piebald.
